set1/1/image_115_thickness_4.png
The blue and red line plots cross each other once in this image. The lines start at different points on the left side of the graph, with the red line higher than the blue line. As they progress to the right, they converge and intersect at a single point before diverging again, with the blue line ending higher than the red line on the right side of the graph.
