The blue and red line plots cross each other twice in this image. The blue line starts below the red line, rises to cross it once on the left side of the graph, continues upward to a peak, then descends to cross the red line again on the right side of the graph before ending below the red line.

set2/2/image_59_thickness_4.png
The blue and red line plots in the image cross each other 2 times. The first crossing occurs near the middle of the graph as the red line rises to intersect the blue line. The second crossing happens towards the right side of the graph as the red line falls below the blue line.

set2/2/image_80_thickness_4.png
The blue and red line plots cross each other 2 times in this image. The lines intersect once as the red line is descending and the blue line is relatively flat, and then they cross again as both lines are ascending, with the red line rising more steeply than the blue line.

set2/2/image_26_thickness_4.png
The blue and red line plots cross each other twice in this image. The first intersection occurs near the left side of the graph as the red line rises to meet the blue line. The second intersection is on the right side of the graph as the red line falls and crosses the blue line again.
